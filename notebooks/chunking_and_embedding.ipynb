    "## Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 300-char chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too small. Each chunk contains very little context, so embeddings may not capture the full semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval may return multiple chunks for a single complaint because the information is split.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 800-char chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too long. Each chunk has plenty of context, but the embedding model may struggle with very long text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Risk: when a user queries a specific detail, long chunks may include lots of irrelevant content, reducing retrieval precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 500-char chunks with 100-char overlap: \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the best balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each chunk is long enough to capture meaningful context, but not so long that embeddings get diluted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 100-char overlap ensures that context is preserved across chunks, so important information that spans chunk boundaries is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval will likely be more precise, returning fewer, more relevant chunks per query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The 500-char chunk size with 100-char overlap is the optimal choice. It balances context preservation, embedding efficiency, and retrieval precision, which is crucial for your RAG system."
